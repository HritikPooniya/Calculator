Calculator using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

//With the help of HTML frontend of the page, button and sign are controlled and in CSS all the decoration is working it is very simple and easy code of calculator by using JAVASCRIPT.

//This is my first Project of frontend and I think this is the best experience.

In javascript code you can see fistly I made a array by using the input of user and store in buttons variable and then using for each loop and arrow function just iterate on ARRAY and on the basis of user events just evaluate the strign according to this.\

Evaluate is function in JAVASCRIPT which solve the mathematical string directly and give the output in hte form of a string. for ex- let string="3+3"; let string1=eval(string); then output is string1 is 6;

Similary we control if user press '=' sign then it means he wants the ans or solution the we just evaluate the string and give the output.

If user press C that means we have to clear the screen means we have to return the empty string.
